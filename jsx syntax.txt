JSX Syntax is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers 
to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. It is a key feature of 
React that makes it easy to create React elements and compose them together to 
create a user interface. Instead of writing separate JavaScript and HTML files, 
JSX allows developers to write both in the same file, making the code more readable 
and easier to maintain. JSX gets compiled into regular JavaScript by a build tool like 
Babel before being rendered in the browser.
