# JSX-in-React

JSX Syntax is a syntax extension to JavaScript that allows developers to write HTML-like code in their JavaScript files. It is a key feature of React that makes it easy to create React elements and compose them together to create a user interface. Instead of writing separate JavaScript and HTML files, JSX allows developers to write both in the same file, making the code more readable and easier to maintain. JSX gets compiled into regular JavaScript by a build tool like Babel before being rendered in the browser.<br>

JSX is strict HTML <br>
It replaces<br>
    Class to className<br>
    For to htmlFor<br>
